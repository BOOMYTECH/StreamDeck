### Stream Deck or Macro Keyboard.
We build a device that allows us to simulate the pressure of specific keys on a computer keyboard to perform shortcuts that can be used by many software such as Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro but also Word Excel PowerPoint and any other software that uses pressure of a button to perform functions.
The device we will create also includes a Joggle which will allow you to simulate pressing some keys by turning a knob clockwise and anti-clockwise.
